### Microcomputers Lab

### Introduction

This repository contains the source code for the lab exercises of the "Microcomputers Lab" course, developed by group 53. Each exercise has its own folder with the corresponding code and a brief description of its purpose.

### Lab Exercise 1

The purpose of the first lab exercise was to familiarize students with assembly language and implement basic functions such as delay and input/output port management.

  * **Problem 1.1**: Implementation of a delay routine in milliseconds.
  * **Problem 1.2**: Calculation of logical functions.
  * **Problem 1.3**: Simulation of a wagon's movement using a bit of the output port.

### Lab Exercise 2

The second lab exercise focused on the use of interrupts and timers.

  * **Problem 2.1**: Measuring interrupts using an external interrupt and a timer.
  * **Problem 2.2**: Controlling LEDs using a timer and interrupts.

### Lab Exercise 3

In the third lab exercise, students worked on creating PWM signals and controlling LED brightness.

  * **Problem 3.1**: Controlling LED brightness using PWM.
  * **Problem 3.2**: Changing LED brightness using ADC and PWM.

### Lab Exercise 4

The fourth lab exercise involved the use of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and communication with an LCD screen.

  * **Problem 4.1**: Measuring voltage using ADC and displaying it on the LCD.
  * **Problem 4.2**: Switching messages on the LCD.

### Lab Exercise 5

In the fifth lab exercise, students used the TWI (Two-Wire Interface) for communication with external devices.

  * **Problem 5.1**: Implementing logical functions using TWI and an external port.
  * **Problem 5.2**: Controlling LEDs using TWI and an external port.
  * **Problem 5.3**: Sending data to the LCD using TWI.

### Lab Exercise 6

The sixth lab exercise focused on reading data from a 4x4 keypad.

  * **Problem 6.1**: Scanning the keypad and converting to ASCII.

### Lab Exercise 7

In the seventh lab exercise, students worked on communication through the UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) serial port.

  * **Problem 7.1**: Implementing routines for One Wire communication.
  * **Problem 7.2**: Sending and receiving data via UART.

### Lab Exercise 8

The eighth lab exercise combined the knowledge from the previous exercises to implement a complete system.

  * **Problem 8.1**: Simulating connection with ESP8266 and sending data through it.
  * **Problem 8.2**: Monitoring patient's temperature and pressure using sensors and communication with LCD.
  * **Problem 8.3**: Sending data to a web server via ESP8266.

### Note

The exercises were implemented using the ATmega328P microcontroller and the Atmel Studio IDE.
